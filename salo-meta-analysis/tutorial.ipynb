    "# Meta-Analysis with NiMARE\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NiMARE?\n",
    "\n",
    "![NiMARE banner](images/nimare_banner.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[NiMARE](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.12/) is a Python library for performing neuroimaging meta-analyses and related analyses, like automated annotation and functional decoding. The goal of NiMARE is to centralize and standardize implementations of common meta-analytic tools, so that researchers can use whatever tool is most appropriate for a given research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already a number of tools for neuroimaging meta-analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <h2>Tool</h2> | <h2>Scope</h2> |\n",
    "| :------------ | :------------- |\n",
    "| <a href=\"https://brainmap.org\"><img src=\"images/brainmap_logo.png\" alt=\"BrainMap\" width=\"400\"/></a> | BrainMap includes a suite of applications for (1) searching its manually-annotated coordinate-based database, (2) adding studies to the database, and (3) running ALE meta-analyses. While search results can be extracted using its Sleuth app, access to the full database requires a collaborative use agreement. |\n",
    "| <a href=\"https://brainmap.org\"><img src=\"images/neurosynth_logo.png\" alt=\"Neurosynth\" width=\"200\"/></a> | Neurosynth provides (1) a large, automatically-extracted coordinate-based database, (2) a website for performing large-scale automated meta-analyses, and (3) a Python library for performing meta-analyses and functional decoding, mostly relying on a version of the MKDA algorithm. The Python library has been deprecated in favor of `NiMARE`. |\n",
    "| <a href=\"https://www.neurovault.org\"><img src=\"images/neurovault_logo.png\" alt=\"Neurovault\" width=\"200\"/></a> | Neurovault is a repository for sharing unthresholded statistical images, which can be used to search for images to use in image-based meta-analyses. Neurovault provides a tool for basic meta-analyses and an integration with Neurosynth's database for online functional decoding. |\n",
    "| <a href=\"https://www.sdmproject.com\"><img src=\"images/sdm_logo.png\" alt=\"SDM\" width=\"200\"/></a> | The Seed-based _d_ Mapping (SDM) app provides a graphical user interface and SPM toolbox for performing meta-analyses with the SDM algorithm, which supports a mix of coordinates and images. |\n",
    "| <a href=\"https://github.com/canlab/Canlab_MKDA_MetaAnalysis\"><img src=\"images/mkda_logo.png\" alt=\"MKDA\" width=\"200\"/></a> | The MATLAB-based MKDA toolbox includes functions for performing coordinate-based meta-analyses with the MKDA algorithm. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the above tools are (1) closed source, (2) based on graphical user interfaces, and/or (3) written in a programming language that is rarely used by neuroimagers, such as Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these established tools, there are always interesting new methods that are described in journal articles, but which are never translated to a well-documented and supported implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "NiMARE attempts to consolidate the different algorithms that are currently spread out across a range of tools (or which never make the jump from paper to tool), while still ensuring that the original tools and papers can be cited appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NiMARE's design philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "NiMARE's API is designed to be similar to that of [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), in that most tools are custom classes. These classes follow the following basic structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the class with general parameters\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cls = Class(param1, param2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For Estimator classes, apply a `fit` method to a `Dataset` object to generate a `MetaResult` object\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = cls.fit(dataset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For Transformer classes, apply a `transform` method to an object to return a transformed version of that object\n",
    "\n",
    "    - An example transformer that accepts a `Dataset`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset = cls.transform(dataset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - A transformer that accepts a `MetaResult`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = cls.transform(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stability and consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "NiMARE is currently in alpha development, so we appreciate any feedback or bug reports users can provide. Given its status, NiMARE's API may change in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage questions can be submitted to [NeuroStars with the 'nimare' tag](https://neurostars.org/tag/nimare), while bug reports and feature requests can be submitted to [NiMARE's issue tracker](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/issues)."

    "## Multiple comparisons correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you will want to follow up your meta-analysis with some form of multiple comparisons correction. For this, NiMARE provides Corrector classes in the `correct` module. Specifically, there are two Correctors: [`FWECorrector`](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.12/generated/nimare.correct.FWECorrector.html) and [`FDRCorrector`](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.12/generated/nimare.correct.FDRCorrector.html). In both cases, the Corrector supports a range of naive correction options that are not optimized for neuroimaging data, like Bonferroni correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to generic multiple comparisons correction, the Correctors also reference algorithm-specific correction methods, such as the `montecarlo` method supported by most coordinate-based meta-analysis algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctors are initialized with parameters, and they have a `transform` method that accepts a `MetaResult` object and returns an updated one with the corrected maps."

    "Functional decoding refers to approaches which attempt to infer mental processes, tasks, etc. from imaging data. There are many approaches to functional decoding, but one set of approaches uses meta-analytic databases like Neurosynth or BrainMap, which we call \"meta-analytic functional decoding.\" For more information on functional decoding in general, read [Poldrack (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3240863/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In NiMARE, we group decoding methods into three general types: discrete decoding, continuous decoding, and encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete decoding methods** use a meta-analytic database and annotations of studies in that database to describe something discrete (like a region of interest) in terms of those annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous decoding methods** use the same type of database to describe an unthresholded brain map in terms of the database's annotations. One example of this kind of method is the Neurosynth-based decoding available on Neurovault. In that method, the map you want to decode is correlated with Neurosynth term-specific meta-analysis maps. You end up with one correlation coefficient for each term in Neurosynth. Users generally report the top ten or so terms.\n",
    "\n",
