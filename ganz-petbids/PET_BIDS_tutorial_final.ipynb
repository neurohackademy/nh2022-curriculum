It is available for both Python and MatLab. Eventually, [PET2BIDS](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS) will also be wrapped inside other BIDS conversion tools such as [BIDScoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin) or [ezBIDS](https://brainlife.io/ezbids/), but this is work in progress at the moment. \n",
