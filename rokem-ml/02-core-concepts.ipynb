    "This is a tutorial about machine learning, so now is probably a good time to explain what we mean by *machine learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a working definition: **machine learning is the field of science/engineering that seeks to build systems capable of learning from experience.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very broad definition, and in practice, the set of activities that get labeled \"machine learning\" is pretty heterogeneous. However, two elements are common to nearly all machine learning applications: (a) the emphasis is on developing algorithms that can learn (semi-)autonomously from data, rather than static rule-based systems that must be explicitly designed or updated by humans; and (b) algorithm evaluation focuses heavily on the ability to meet objective quantitative targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can contrast machine learning with traditional scientific inference, where the goal (or at least, *a* goal) is to *understand* or *explain* how a system operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of prediction and explanation are not mutually exclusive, of course. But most people tend to favor one over the other to some extent. And, as a rough generalization, people who do machine learning tend to be more interested in figuring out how to make useful predictions than in arriving at a \"true\", or even just an approximately correct, model of the data-generating process underlying a given phenomenon. By contrast, people interested in explanation might be willing to accept models that don't make the strongest possible predictions (or often, even good ones) so long as those models provide some insight into the mechanisms that seem to underlie the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't need to take a principled position on the prediction vs. explanation divide here (plenty has been written on the topic; see for example [this paper](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1009213726), [this paper](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ss/1294167961), or [this one](https://talyarkoni.org/pdf/Yarkoni_PPS_2017.pdf)). Just be aware that, for purposes of this tutorial, we're going to assume that our goal is mainly to generate good predictions, and that understanding and interpretability are secondary or tertiary on our list of desiderata (though we'll still say something about them now and then)."

    "Broadly speaking, machine learning can be carved up into two forms of learning: **supervised** and **unsupervised**. We say that learning is supervised whenever we know the true values that our model is trying to predict, and hence, are in a position to \"supervise\" the learning process by quantifying prediction accuracy and making iterative adjustments. \"Ordinary\" least-squares regression, in the machine learning context, is an example of supervised learning: our model takes as its input both a vector of *features* (conventionally labeled `X`) and a vector of *labels* (`y`). Researchers often use different terminology in various biomedical and social science disciplines—often calling `X` *variables* or *predictors*, and `y` the *outcome* or *dependent variable*—but the idea is the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Supervised learning: classification vs. regression\n",
    "Within the class of supervised learning problems, we can draw a further distinction between **classification** problems and **regression** problems. In both cases, the goal is to develop a predictive model that recovers the true labels as accurately as possible. The difference between the two lies in the nature of the labels: in classification, the labels are discrete; in regression, they're continuous. \n",

The main input to virtually all *estimators* (we'll explain what those are momentarily) is a 2-dimensional array of samples x features—i.e., each row is a different observation, and each column contains a single feature. Conventionally, this array is labeled `X`. Fortunately for us, this is exactly the format our ABIDE data are already in, so there's very little we need to do in order to construct appropriate `X` inputs. Let's just make sure our `X` only contains those features we want our models to learn from. In the examples we'll work through, we'll be using only the structural brain features as our features, so let's make sure `X` contains only those columns.\n",

    "While scikit-learn includes hundreds of different estimators that generate predictions in very different ways, they all share a common interface (or *API*). In particular, every estimator class implements `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods. When we call an estimator's `.fit()` method, we're telling it to take some training data—including a mandatory `X` matrix, and an optional `y` vector (if it's a supervised estimator)—and do something with it. In cases where `y` is present, the estimator is generally trying to learn how to predict the values of `y` from the values in `X`. Once it's done that, we can then call `predict()`, which takes another `X` matrix (either the same one as before, or a different one) and predicts corresponding `y` scores.\n",

The fact that the correlations are still pretty weak (on the order of r = .15 - .2), and that it's very hard to see any separation in the resulting plot, might lead us to suspect that this is going to be a pretty difficult classification problem."

    "While a brief pat on the back does seem appropriate, we probably shouldn't be *too* pleased with ourselves. We've learned some important concepts in machine learning, explored the basic mechanics of scikit-learn estimators, and applied our knowledge to a few representative problems dealing with neuroimaging data. But as the saying goes, a little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. We haven't yet touched on are a number of concepts and techniques that are absolutely critical if we want to avoid going off the rails with the skills we've just acquired. And going off the rails is surprisingly easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate just *how* easy, let's return to our brain-age regression example. Recall that when we fitted our linear regression model in an effort to predict age from our brain features, we sub-sampled only a small number of features (5, to be exact). As we saw, even with just 5 features, our model was able to capture a non-trivial fraction of the variance in age—about 20%. Intuitively, you might find yourself thinking something like this: *if we can do that well with just 5 randomly-selected features, imagine how well we can do with more features!* And you might want to go back to the middle of this notebook (if you haven't already) and replace the `N_FEATURES` variable with some larger number, re-run the relevant cells, and see how well you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll save you the trip back up there; we'll do this systematically. Let's re-fit our linear regression model with random feature subsets of different sizes and see what effect that has on performance."

    "At first glance, this might look great: performance improves rapidly with the number of features, and by the time we're sampling 1,000 features, we can predict age perfectly!

    "Set aside the brain data for a moment and just think about the problem of measuring chronological age. Is it plausible to think that, in a sample of over 1,000 people, including many young children and older adults, not a single person's age is measured with even the slightest bit of error? Remember, *any* measurement error should reduce our linear regression model's performance, because measurement error is irreducible. If an ABIDE-II participant's birth date happened to be recorded as 1971 when it's actually 1961 (oops, typo!), it's not as if our linear regression model can somehow learn to go back in time and adjust for that error.\n",

    "Then think about the complexity of the brain-derived features we're using; how well (or poorly) *those* features are measured/extracted; how simple our linear regression model is; and how much opportunity there is for all kinds of data quality problems to arise (is it plausible to think that all subjects' scans are of good enough quality to extract near-perfect features?). If you spend a couple of minutes thinking along these lines, it should become very clear that an $R^2$ of 1.0 for a problem like this is just not remotely believable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, there must be something very wrong with our model. And there is: our model is *overfitting* our data. Because we have a lot of features to work with, and not enough samples, our linear regression model is, in a sense getting creative: it's finding all kinds of patterns in the data that look like they're there, but aren't really there. In a word, our model is starting to hallucinate.\n",
